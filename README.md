## Conclusion of the Analysis
- We can observe that the most frequent content in netflix up to 2019 is produced in US and India.
- For the content produced in US we can see that 23.33% are movies and the rest are TV Series, while for the content produced in India added in Netflix are only movies.
- For both type of contents (movies and tv series) the most common rating is the TV-MA, which is related for content for more than 18 years old, so we can assume Netflix has been focusing mainly in the adult audience.
- Finally in general the content has an average duration of 100 minutes for movies and 1 session for tv series (one possible reason is that Netflix is either focusing on mini-series or most of the series available don't get enough audience to renew for a second session)

Also, we can see the majority of the content in the plattform is targted to people +18 years old.
