# # Netflix Analysis

## Business Case

The entertainment industry is rapidly evolving, with streaming platforms like Netflix leading the charge in content distribution. Netflix, as one of the largest streaming services globally, has an extensive library of TV shows and movies catering to various audiences. Analyzing the Netflix content database helps uncover valuable insights into the platform's content trends, audience targeting, and business strategy. By understanding these trends, Netflix can refine its content strategy, optimize its offerings, and continue to attract and retain users across diverse markets.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this analysis is to identify and understand the trends in Netflix's content library as of 2019. By analyzing the available data, we aim to highlight key insights into the geographical distribution of content, the types of shows and movies available, their ratings, durations, and how Netflix may have tailored its offerings to appeal to a specific demographic. The findings can be valuable for content creators, marketers, and Netflix itself to better understand its content strategy and improve user engagement.

## Description of the Dataset

The dataset contains information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. It includes details such as:
- **Title**: Name of the TV show or movie
- **Type**: Whether the content is a movie or a TV series
- **Country**: Where the content was produced
- **Rating**: Age rating assigned to the content
- **Duration**: Length of the content (for movies) or the number of seasons (for TV series)

This dataset offers a snapshot of Netflix's content up until 2019 and serves as the basis for the analysis.

## Analysis and Conclusion

After analyzing the data, several key insights emerged:

- We can observe that the most frequent content in netflix up to 2019 is produced in US and India.
-For the content produced in US we can see that 23.33% are movies and the rest are TV Series, while for the content produced in India added in Netflix are only movies.
- For both type of contents (movies and tv series) the most common rating is the TV-MA, which is related for content for more than 18 years old, so we can assume Netflix has been focusing mainly in the adult audience.
- Finally in general the content has an average duration of 100 minutes for movies and 1 session for tv series (one possible reason is that Netflix is either focusing on mini-series or most of the series available don't get enough audience to renew for a second session)
- After analysing the data we can conclude that up to 2019 most movies in Netflix has been produced in US, India and UK which we can assume Netflix has been focused in release english content. Also, we can see the majority of the content in the plattform is targted to people +18 years old. We can assume that Netflix has focused on this segment because it is the most attractive to their audience, helping the platform retain existing users while also attracting new ones, which can drive revenue growth.
